This code was created to Predict Gold price based on data set :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/gold-price-prediction-dataset as project to apply Regression models (Linear regression, Gradiant boost, XG Booost , Random forest)


Also we  used cluster of machines to run pyspark in parallel using docker and Dockercompose.


Technologies used: 

Pyspark 

Python 3.x

matplotlib 

  for running the code parallel: 

  Docker 




Pre-requests of the enviroment: 

envoreoment should have 

	Python 3.x 


	pyspark  



1 - put the data set Excell file (FINAL_USO.csv)  besides the code in same folder

2 - Run the code using python 3.x 

open the terminal (CMD ) and run :  node <Code-file-name.py >

    example: python .\Linear-regression-gold-Tuning.py
